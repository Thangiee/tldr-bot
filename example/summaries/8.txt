After meeting off-and-on with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov for nearly 10 hours in Geneva on Friday, Kerry stated that the U.S. and Russia "achieved clarity" on a path to restore a truce in Syria but details remain to be worked out.
And, underscoring deep differences over developments on the ground, Kerry noted that Russia disputes the U.S. "narrative" of recent attacks on heavily populated areas being conducted by Syrian forces, Russia itself and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia.
U.S. officials say it is imperative that Russia use its influence with Syria's Bashar Assad to halt all attacks on moderate opposition forces, open humanitarian aid corridors, and concentrate any offensive action on Daesh and other extremists not covered by what has become a largely ignored truce.
Meanwhile, in a blow to the opposition, rebel forces and civilians in the besieged Damascus suburb of Daraya were to be evacuated on Friday after agreeing to surrender the town late Thursday after four years of grueling bombardment and a crippling siege that left the sprawling area in ruins.
