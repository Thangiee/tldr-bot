Tesla Motors moved a step closer in its bid to buy SolarCity after federal regulators said the $ 2.6 billion deal doesn't present antitrust concerns.
Tesla announced plans to purchase the solar panel installer earlier this month, and Reuters says the Federal Trade Commission quickly signed off "because the merging companies have few or no overlaps."
SolarCity agreed to the deal amid decreased expectations of growth for the company.
