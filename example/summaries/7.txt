Former prime minister Stephen Harper announced Friday his long-expected resignation from the Commons and his Calgary seat in the low-key fashion he adopted after losing his majority government last fall.
Harper bade farewell as leader to his party faithful at the Conservative convention in May in a rare public speech that echoed themes of his goodbye statement Friday.
In July, Harper angered many Conservatives at his annual summer barbecue by endorsing Jason Kenney, his former cabinet colleague and Calgary political neighbour, while Kenney's opponents sat in the audience, as the leader to do what he did for national conservatives : unite the right-wing parties in Alberta.
Interim Conservative leader Rona Ambrose issued a statement Friday that ensured Harper shared credit with small-c conservatives for the party's formation and record.
