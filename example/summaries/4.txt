Tesla Motors moved a step closer in its bid to buy SolarCity after federal regulators said the $ 2.6 billion deal doesn't present antitrust concerns.
Tesla announced plans to purchase the solar panel installer earlier this month, and Reuters says the Federal Trade Commission quickly signed off "because the merging companies have few or no overlaps."
SolarCity agreed to the deal amid decreased expectations of growth for the company.
"SolarCity blamed the rapid burn in the second quarter in part on Tesla's initial takeover announcement, saying it complicated getting some financing in the door by the end of June.
