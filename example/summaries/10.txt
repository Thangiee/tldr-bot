Las Vegas is fairly new to the business of being a potential host for professional football, but the group that's trying to bring the Raiders there is already employing a good old-fashioned NFL shakedown.
According to the Associated Press, the group headed by Sheldon Adelson told a local oversight committee last night that they needed no less than $ 750 million of public money for the project, and would walk away from their project if they don't get it.
Adelson and his company are also trying to rush the project through a September special legislative session, so they can secure the funding before the next NFL owners meeting in January.
