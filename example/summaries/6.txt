For the first time ever this year, the FBI will collect data on animal cruelty crimes via its National Incident-Based Reporting System -LRB- NIBRS -RRB-.
The policy, which went into effect on Jan. 1, has been years in the making, originating with animal welfare advocate Mary Lou Randour, who convinced the FBI in 2014 that tracking animal abuse was a worthy endeavor.
Not only is the new policy a shift towards treating animals more humanely, it could also help law enforcement take a bite out of human crime.
