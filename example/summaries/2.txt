Republican senator Rand Paul is considering trying to block a US arms sales agreement with Saudi Arabia after labeling the country an "unreliable ally" and questioning its human rights record.
They co-authored a bipartisan bill in April that would have forced the president to certify that the Saudis were "taking all feasible precautions to reduce the risk of harm to civilians" in Yemen before further arms deals were brokered.
"If you talk to Yemeni Americans, they will tell you in Yemen this isn't a Saudi bombing campaign, it's a US bombing campaign," Mr Murphy said in June, as reported by Defense News.
While there is no stable government in Yemen, the country has also seen a surge in al-Qaeda fighters.
